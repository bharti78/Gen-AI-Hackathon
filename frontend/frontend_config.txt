# Create a file named .env.local in your frontend directory with this content:

NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# This will fix the API endpoint issue where it's currently calling:
# http://localhost:3000/account/undefined/api/genaimech/signup

# After adding this file, restart your Next.js development server
